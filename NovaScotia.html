    <p class="paragraph">This major tourist hot spot makes no secret of its treacherous location. The lighthouse atop smooth, weather-worn rocks is picture-perfect, but the whole place can be dangerous and downright fatal when rough weather hits and the rocks get slippery. One local legend tells the story of an original resident, Margaret (nicknamed Peggy), who settled here after surviving a shipwreck nearby. Her children didn’t make it, and she would regularly walk the rocks at night, grieving their loss. One night, her new husband went out with her and danced on the rocks to cheer her up. But he slipped and died, and Margaret later took her own life. Visitors to Peggy’s Cove have reportedly seen the ghost of a woman in a blue dress standing at the edge of the rocks, about to jump.</p>
